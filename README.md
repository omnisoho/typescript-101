# What is TypeScript ? :nerd_face:
TypeScript is
* an object-oriented programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft
* a superset of JavaScript and contains all of its elements
* built on javascript even though it uses the .ts extenson instead of the .js extension
* easily compiled to plain javascript via a TypeScript compiler


# Why use TypeScript ? :thinking:
* Static typing makes large scale applications more robust and less prone to bugs
* OOP concepts such as Classes, Interfaces, Inheritance etc are supported
* Many frameworks support TypeScript so it is easy to adopt it for your development
